# OCI Landing Zone Models

## Overview

Welcome to the OCI Landing Zone Models.

The objective of this asset is to present the most common landing zone models used with our customers, as examples of landing zones tailored from the OCI Open LZ blueprint.

There are several landing zone models:
- Model 1 -  [The OE/BU Landing Zone](#model-1---the-oebu-landing-zone)
- Model 2 - [The Service Landing Zone](#model-2---the-service-landing-zone)
- Model 3 - [The Environment Landing Zone](#model-3---the-environment-landing-zone)
- Model 4 - [The Project Landing Zone](#model-4---the-project-landing-zone)
- Model 5 - [The Application Domain Landing Zone](#model-5---the-application-domain-landing-zone)

&nbsp; 

Note that other models exist, different or derivated from these. The objective is not to be exhaustive, but to present different possible flavors.

Find available the [draw.io file](/design/models/OCI_OpenLZ_Models.drawio) for further design activities on top of them.
